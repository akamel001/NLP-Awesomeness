To execute the program:

	* unzip files to a directory
	* cd src
	* java -classpath ../bin/ Project1 <dataset file> 
	
	(ie. $java -classpath ../bin/ Project1 ../data/Dataset4/Train.txt)

File notes: 
	Project1.java contains all the global variables used to determine the state of 
	things. The following describes the variables

	(LANGUAGE_MODEL_ORDER)
	Is used to determine the n-gram model you want. For a bigram model set the
	variable to 2. For trigram set the variable to 3. 
	
     	(K_SAMPLE_REJECT)
	This variable is used to determine the number of times a period would get rejected
	if chosen in the random sentence generator 

	(SENTENCE_WORD_LIMIT)
	This variable is used to determine how many words get set in a sentence. Currently
	its set to -1 so its disabled. Values above -1 determine the sentence size. 

    	(SENTENCE_SAMPLE) 
	Used for optimization. Once the corpus has been tokenized and loaded in memory,
	this variable determines how many sentences will be generated. So re-executing the
	program to generate a sentence is not required. Set this variable to determine how
	many random sentences will be generated.
