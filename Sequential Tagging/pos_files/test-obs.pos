was
tailor-made
for

By
pressuring

Mr.

But
through

so
far

the
U.S.

Mr.
Noriega
was

He
signed
up

counter-intelligence

returning

Americas
in
Panama

two-month
course
called
``
military
intelligence

''
<s>
Some
American
officers
interpreted
his
eagerness
and
studiousness
as
a
sign
of
loyalty
,
but
they
did
so
falsely
.
<s>
He
rose
to
chief
of
intelligence
in
Panama
's
socalled
G-2

1970

providing
populist
dictator
Torrijos

Even

During

became
dismayed
at
the
extent
of
the
G-2

.
<s>
One
DEA
agent
drew
up
a
list

,
one
of
which
was
assassination
.
<s>
The
head
of
the
DEA
at
the
time

John
Ingersoll
,
scotched
the
assassination
plan
.
<s>
But
he
did
fly
to
Panama
to
scold
dictator
Torrijos
on
the
drug
ties
of
Panamanian
officials
,
including
Mr.
Noriega
.
<s>
Mr.
Ingersoll
later
recalled
that
Gen.

on

``
Everybody
was
afraid

''
Mr.
Ingersoll
says
.
<s>
Mr.

became
an
even
greater

Intelligence

Old

Medicine
in
the
19th
century

dedicated
mostly
to

diagnostic
analysis

<s>
Then
the
20th
century
saw
the
evolution

private-sector

drugs

therapy

The
process
dramatically
increased
our
average

much
pain

constantly
improved
health

<s>
Most
public-health

New
Environmentalism
probably
started
in

book

appear

These

Writing

Ms.

suggested

Your
story
missed
some
essential
points
of
the
conference
on
``
The
Global
Environment
:
Are
We
Overreacting
?
''
<s>
First
and
foremost
,
the
vignettes
presented
by
the
various
scientists
represent
a
general
consensus
among
specialists
working
in
the
respective
aspects
of
the
global
environment
.
<s>
Consider
,
for
example
,
the
greenhouse
effect
and
climate
change
;
numerous
blue-ribbon
scientific
committees
,
including
one
from
the
National
Academy
of
Science
,
judge
there
is
a
greater
than
50
%
probability
of
a
grave
problem
in
the
offing
.
<s>
The
point
was
to
answer
the
question
in
the
conference
title
,
not
to
try
to
create
news
stories
for
the
event
itself
.
<s>
Nor
was
it
intended
to
dictate
a
set
of
prescriptive
solutions
,
although
various
points
were
raised
.
<s>
Each
speaker
was
asked
to
address
a
specific
topic
,
not
deliver
a
point
of
view
.
<s>
Each
scientist
independently
concluded
society
and
government
are
underreacting
when
it
comes
to
substantive
policy
change
.
<s>
This
leads
to
a
very
special
sense
of
urgency
.
<s>
If
the
media
decide
to
work
harder
at
educating
the
public
about
these
complex
and
technical
issues
,
that
hardly
can
be
termed
non-objective
journalism
.
<s>
The
environment
can
no
longer
be
a
normal
issue
,
to
be
dealt
with
on
a
business-as-usual
basis
with
comfortable
increments
of
change
.
<s>
We
have
literally
altered
the
chemistry
and
physics
of
our
planet
's
atmosphere
.
<s>
This
portends
consequences
from
what
we
have
already
done
that
will
be
very
destabilizing
to
social
and
economic
systems
.
<s>
The
problems
of
the
environment
are
so
interrelated
,
so
inextricably
entwined
with
our
current
way
of
life
and
so
large
that
it
is
unlikely
we
will
be
able
to
address
them
effectively
unless
major
changes
are
made
in
less
than
10
years
.
<s>
The
consensus
from
the
scientific
community
is
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
advise
major
policy
changes

<s>
No

we
are

Key
to

serious

have

Before

ostentatiously
withdrawn

20,000

Soviet
Central
Asian
KGB
Border
Guards
,
ethnically
indistinguishable
from
Afghans
and
wearing
unmarked
uniforms
.
<s>
Meanwhile
,
the
Kabul
regime
is
increasingly
successful
at
portraying
the
resistance
as
bloody-minded
fanatics
.
<s>
In
this
they
are
aided
by
years
of
American
,
European
,
Pakistani
and
Saudi
support
for
the
most
extreme
factions
--
radical
Islamic
fanatics
with
leaders

policies

anathema
to
the
Afghan
public

<s>
This
heavy
outside
support

undermined

In
autumn
last
year
,
for
example
,
the

Kandahar
was
prepared
to
surrender
the
city

resistance
moderates

At
the
last
minute

Pakistani
officials
sent

Gulbuddin

perhaps
the
most
hated
and
feared
of
the
extremists
,
with
a
demand
that
the
surrender
be
made
to
his
forces
.
<s>
The
deal
fell
through
,
and
Kandahar
remains
a
major
regime
base
.
<s>
The
resistance
lacks
not
only
air
power
,
armor
and
expertise
but
often
such
essentials
as
maps
,
mine
detectors
,
or
even
winter
gloves
.
<s>
Experienced
resistance
commanders
wanted
to
use
guerrilla
action
and
siege
tactics
to
wear
down
the
regime
.
<s>
Instead
,
they
were
pressured
by
Pakistan
's
ISI
,
the
channel
for
their
support
,
into
attacking
Jalalabad
.
<s>
They
took
more
than
25
%
casualties

journalists
report
that
they
faced

mine
detectors

<s>
The
wonder
is
not
that
the
resistance
has
failed
to
topple
the
Kabul
regime

and
fight
at

off

it
is
not
clear
how
much
is
being
sent

when

will
arrive

For
months
the

defenseless

Thus
far
there
is
no
indication
that
they
have
been
re-supplied
with
Stingers
or
other
anti-aircraft
weapons
.
<s>
Indeed
,
U.S.
officials
have
indicated
to
the
press
that
the
continuation
of
aid
depends
on
what
success
the
weakened
resistance
achieves
by
the
end
of
this
year
.
<s>
Moscow
and
Kabul
must
have
found
that
information
useful

For
a
decade
U.S.

group
that
opposes

He
said
that

recalled
to

a

infelicitous
''
analogy
he
once
heard
arguing
``

have
finally
recognized

have
rights
,

need
to
do
the
same
for

<s>
''
Mr.
Allen
objected
to
this
analogy
because
it
seems
to
``
assimilate
the
status
of
blacks
to
that
of
animals
--
as
a
mere
project
of
charity
,
of
humaneness
.
''
<s>
Rights

such
a
basis

whether
for
blacks

are
``

indulgences
,
''
he
said
,
subject
to
being
taken
back

He
says
the
title
of
his
speech
was
to
make
his
point
that
Americans
have
rights
as
individuals
,
not
as
members
of
certain
select
groups
.
<s>
His
speech
criticized
the
``
idiocy

notions

groups

society

as
opposed
to
individual
equality

,
as
he
put
it
,
in
``
a
common
destiny
as
Americans
.
''
<s>
Instead
of
lobbying
for
special
treatment
,
Mr.
Allen
said
that
homosexuals
and
others
should
try
to
ensure
equal
treatment
under
the
law
and
not
aim
for
special
privileges
that
would
risk
``

This
hardly
sounds

an
anti-homosexual

.

What
's
really
going
on
here
?
<s>
The
three
most
important
things
to
understand
about
Mr.
Allen
is
that
he
is
a
black
conservative
intellectual
--
a
triple
threat
to
the
liberal
establishment
.
<s>
Mr.
Allen
,
who
teaches
government
at
prestigious
Harvey
Mudd
College
in
California
and
will
remain
a
member
of
the
commission
,
has
spent
years
arguing
that
civil
rights
are
individuals
'
rights
.
<s>
He
last
made
waves
when
he
dared
to
defend
an
Indian
girl
who
had
been
adopted
by
non-Indian
parents
off
her
reservation
.
<s>
Mr.
Allen
quickly
ran
up
against
the
liberal
establishment
again
,
which
somehow
elevated
the
vague
concept
of
``
Indian
rights
''
above
the
rights
of
individual
Indians
.
<s>
There
is
a
huge
divide
between
Mr.
Allen
's
we're-all-in-this-together
view
and
the
divisive
litigation
approach
of
the
civil
rights
groups
.
<s>
Indeed
,
the
gap
is
so
large
that
Mr.
Allen
's
critics
refuse
to
engage
the
debate
.
<s>
Their
ridicule
of
him
is
no
substitute
for
argument
.
<s>
Their
effort
to
run
him
out

Washington
is
an
embarrassment
to
the
original
purpose
of
their
own
movement

We
hope
the

head
of

be

most

liquidity

the
ability

get
in

quickly
.
<s>
Prices
are
moving
up

Institutions

count

able

buy
and
sell

when

volatility
get
built
into

<s>
One
new
investment
style
called

asset
allocation

shifts
portfolio
weightings
between

one

For

,
First

Monday

When

the

<s>
A
classic
example
of
institutions
'
hunger
for
liquidity
is
portfolio
insurance
,
now
widely
discredited
.
<s>
Before
the
1987
crash
,
an
estimated
$
60
billion
in
institutional
money
was
managed
under
this
hedging
technique
.
<s>
The
idea
was
to
``
insure
''
the
value
of
a
portfolio
by
selling
futures
when
stock
prices
dropped
--
eliminating
the
need
to
sell
the
stocks
themselves
.
<s>
But
in
October
1987
,
when
portfolio
insurers
rushed
to
sell
at
the
same
time
,
they
overwhelmed
both
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.
<s>
Yet
even
today
,
institutions
are
quietly
practicing
forms
of
portfolio
insurance
by
nervously
rushing
to
and
fro
in
the
markets
.

Others
are
doing
``
index
arbitrage
''
a
strategy
of
taking
advantage
of
price
discrepancies
between
stocks
and
futures
.
<s>
Unlike
traditional
buy-and-hold
strategies
,
all
of
the
above
require
that
market
makers
be
on
hand
to
provide
liquidity
by
buying
and
selling
stocks
in
a
crunch
.
<s>
But
institutions

Wall
Street

less
willing

make
markets

Brokers
do

that

that

with
institutional

far
lower
than

the
1970s
,
securities
firms
ca
n't
afford
to
take
the
risk

conduct
to
be
against
the
public
interest
and
hence
criminal
,
while
well
established
in
British
law
,
would
usurp
legislative
authority
under
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
.
<s>
That
's
the
conventional
theory
anyway
.
<s>
In
practice
,
however
,
the
line
between
interpretation
and
redefinition
of
the
criminal
law
long
ago
began
to
blur
.
<s>
In
particular
,
a
common
law
of
white-collar
crime
has
developed
with
surprising
rapidity
over
the
past
decade
.
<s>
For
example
,
although
insider
trading
has
long
been
criminal
,
it
has
never
been
statutorily
defined
.
<s>
In
1983
,
the
Supreme
Court
tried
to
supply
a
workable
definition
in
the
Dirks
v.
SEC
decision
,
which
found
that
liability
depended
on
whether
the
tipper
had
breached
his
fiduciary
duty
to
the
corporation
in
order
to
obtain
``
some
personal
gain
''
and
whether
the
tippee
knew
or
recklessly
disregarded
this
fact
.
<s>
Gradually
,
however
,
lower
courts
and
prosecutors
have
pushed
this
definition
to
its
breaking
point
.
<s>
Consider
the
facts
underlying
the
1989
conviction
of
Robert
Chestman
.
<s>
Prior
to
a
tender
offer
by
A&P
for
Waldbaum
Inc.
in
1986
,
the
founder
of
the
Waldbaum
's
supermarket
chain
called
an
elderly
relative
to
tell
her
to
assemble
her
stock
certificates
for
delivery
.
<s>
She
called
her
daughter
to
take
her
to
the
bank
,
who
,
in
turn
,
persuaded
her
husband
,
a
Mr.
Loeb
,
to
run
this
errand
.
<s>
Hearing
of
this
information
,
the
husband
discussed
it
with
his
broker
,
Mr.
Chestman
,
and
Mr.
Chestman
then
bought
for
his
own
account
and
other
clients
.
<s>
Basically
,
Mr.
Chestman
was
a
fourth-level
tippee
.
<s>
Did
Mr.
Loeb
,
his
tipper
,
breach
a
fiduciary
duty
-LRB-
and
,
if
so
,
to
whom
-RRB-
?
<s>
Did
Mr.
Loeb
seek
personal
gain
-LRB-
and
if
so
,
how
-RRB-
?
<s>
Or
did
Mr.
Chestman
only
hear
a
market
rumor
-LRB-
which
one
may
lawfully
trade
upon
-RRB-
?
<s>
The
line
seems
awfully
thin
for
criminal-law
purposes
.
<s>
A
second
illustration
is
supplied
by
the
recent
guilty
plea
entered
by
Robert
Freeman
,
formerly
head
of
arbitrage
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.
<s>
Essentially
,
Mr.
Freeman
had
invested
heavily
in
the
Beatrice
leveraged
buy-out
,
when
he
was
told
by
another
prominent
trader
,
Bernard
``
Bunny
''
Lasker
,
that
the
deal
was
in
trouble
.
<s>
After
placing
orders
to
sell
,
Mr.
Freeman
called
Martin
Siegel
,
an
investment
banker
at
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co.
,
who
was
advising
on
the
deal
,
to
confirm
these
rumors
.
<s>
Mr.
Siegel
asked
Mr.
Freeman
who
his
source
was
and
,
on
hearing
that
it
was
Bunny
Lasker
,
responded
:
``
Well
,
your
bunny
has
a
good
nose
.
''
<s>
The
illegal
``
tip
''
of
the
bunny
's
good
nose
was
then
largely
a
confirmation
of
rumors
already
known
to
many
in
the
market
.
<s>
Had
the
case
gone
to
trial
the
same
issues
would
have
surfaced
:
<s>
Was
there
a
fiduciary
breach
in
order
to
obtain
personal
gain
?
<s>
Did
Mr.
Freeman
have
notice
of
this
?
<s>
Finally
,
was
the
information
material
?
<s>
Yet
,
all
these
issues
are
subsidiary
to
a
more
central
issue
:
Who
is
and
who
should
be
making
the
criminal
law
here
?
<s>
It
is
not
my
contention
that
either
Mr.
Chestman
or
Mr.
Freeman
was
an
innocent
victim
of
prosecutorial
overzealousness
.
<s>
Arguably
,
both
were
on
notice
that
their
behavior
was
at
least
risky
.
<s>
But
even
if
they
behaved
recklessly
,
reasons
still
exist
to
fear
and
resist
this
steady
process
of
case-by-case
judicial
extension
of
the
law
of
insider
trading
.
<s>
Courts
and
legislatures
make
decisions
in
very
different
ways
and
are
each
susceptible
to
very
different
kinds
of
errors
.
<s>
After-the-fact
judicial
examination
of
an
actor
's
conduct
has
always
been
the
common
law
's
method
.
<s>
When
only
civil
liability
is
involved
,
this
method
has
the
undeniable
strengths
of
factual
specificity
and
avoidance
of
overgeneralization
.
<s>
Still
,
case-by-case
retrospective
decision
making
of
this
sort
is
vulnerable
to
the
tunnel
vision
caused
by
a
fixation
on
ad
hoc
-LRB-
and
usually
sleazy
-RRB-
examples
.
<s>
When
a
court
decides
that
a
particular
actor
's
conduct
was
culpable
and
so
extends
the
definition
of
insider
trading
to
reach
this
conduct
,
it
does
not
see
the
potentially
enormous
number
of
other
cases
that
will
be
covered
by
the
expanded
rule
.
<s>
Thus
,
a
court
is
poorly
positioned
to
make
judgments
about
the
social
utility
of
the
expanded
rule
.
<s>
For
example
,
in
focusing
on
Mr.
Freeman
's
attempt
to
gain
nonpublic
information
about
a
deal
's
collapse
,
one
does
not
naturally
think
about
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin
:
What
if
the
rumor
had
been
false
?
<s>
Can
a
security
analyst
call
an
investment
banker
to
make
certain
that
a
seemingly
improbable
rumor
is
in
fact
false
?
<s>
In
the
past
,
not
only
would
reputable
professionals
have
rushed
to
check
out
such
rumors
with
the
company
,
but
companies
listed
on
the
major
stock
exchanges
were
encouraged
by
the
exchanges
to
respond
openly
to
such
inquiries
from
securities
analysts
.
<s>
Today
,
after
Mr.
Freeman
's
plea
,
there
is
an
uncertainty
that
is
both
unfair
and
inefficient
.
<s>
In
this
light
,
the
comparative
advantages
of
legislative
law-making
become
clear
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
Before
it
acts
,
the
legislature
typically
will
hear
the
views
of
representatives
of
all
those
affected
by
its
decision
,
not
just
the
immediate
parties
before
the
court
;
and
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
the
legislature
can
frame
``
bright
line
''
standards
that
create
less
uncertainty
than
the
fact-bound
decisions
of
courts
.
<s>
Although
legislative
lines
can
result
in
under-inclusion
-LRB-
which
explains
why
the
SEC
has
long
resisted
a
legislative
definition
of
insider
trading
-RRB-
,
judicial
lawmaking
inevitably
creates
uncertainty
because
of
the
shadowy
outer
edges
and
implications
of
most
judicial
decisions
.
<s>
At
least
when
the
stakes
are
high
,
uncertainty
in
turn
results
in
overinclusion
,
as
individuals
do
not
dare
to
approach
an
uncertain
line
closely
.
<s>
The
federal
mail
and
wire
fraud
statutes
provide
even
better
illustrations
of
the
rapid
evolution
of
a
federal
common
law
of
white-collar
crime
.
<s>
In
1987
,
the
Supreme
Court
attempted
in
McNally
v.
U.S.
to
halt
the
inexorable
expansion
of
these
statutes
by
adopting
a
rule
of
strict
construction
for
ambiguous
criminal
statues
.
<s>
Yet
,
late
last
year
,
Congress
effectively
reversed
this
decision
by
enacting
a
one-sentence
statute
that
defined
fraud
to
include
any
scheme
to
deprive
another
of
``
the
intangible
right
of
honest
services
.
''
<s>
At
a
stroke
,
this
may
criminalize
all
fiduciary
breaches
-LRB-
and
possibly
all
misrepresentations
by
an
agent
or
employee
-RRB-
.
<s>
Such
a
statute
illustrates
the
fundamental
problem
:
Congress
finds
it
is
easier
to
pass
sweepingly
moralistic
prohibitions
,
which
the
courts
must
thereafter
interpret
,
than
to
engage
in
the
difficult
line-drawing
distinctions
that
are
inherently
its
responsibility
.
<s>
We
are
confronted
less
with
a
judicial
power
grab
than
with
a
legislative
giveaway
.
<s>
Predictably
,
when
confronted
with
morally
dubious
behavior
,
prosecutors
will
exploit
the
latitude
such
openended
statutes
give
them
.
<s>
Over
the
long
run
,
however
,
sleazy
cases
will
make
bad
law

administration
announced
its
intention
to
decide

yearend
the
size
of

next
increase
in

IMF
's
capital
base
.
<s>

share
of

increase
probably
will
not
reach
the
$
12
billion
or
more
implicit
in
the
IMF
's
request
for
a
doubling
of
its
$
90
billion
capital
,
the
administration
probably
will
agree
to
a
multibillion-dollar
increase
.
<s>
This
would
be
consistent
with
its
unwavering
support
for
the
Brady
Plan
and
G-7
exchange-rate
intervention
,
and
with
its
financial
commitment
to
Mexico
,
Poland
and
others
.
<s>
The
IMF
has
several
reasons
for
requesting
the
increase
.
<s>
Its
role
in
the
economies
of
developing
countries
has
grown
steadily
since
the
1970s
.
<s>
The
size
and
pace
of
disbursements
will
accelerate
further
under
the
Brady
Plan
,
which
promises
larger
and
earlier
disbursements
to
approved
countries
.
<s>
At
least
three
other
factors
have
encouraged
the
IMF
to
insist
on
increased
capital
.
<s>
First
,
it
argues
that
its
capital
base
must
be
increased
in
order
to
maintain
its
size
relative
to
world
financial
markets
,
for
which
it
feels
some
responsibility
.
<s>
Second
,
the
World
Bank
's
recent
$
75
billion
capital
increase
--
$
14
billion
from
the
U.S.
--
has
left
the
IMF
feeling
less
than
first
fiddle
among
international
financial
institutions
.
<s>
Third
,
the
IMF
would
like
to
meet
Japan
's
request
for
increased
ownership
-LRB-
currently
4.5
%
-RRB-
.
<s>
Japan
has
supported
a
larger
role
for
the
IMF
in
developing-country
debt
issues
,
and
is
an
important
financial
resource
for
IMF-guided
programs
in
developing
countries
.
<s>
While
international
politics
may
argue
for
the
capital
increase
,
there
is
a
clear
economic
case
against
it
.
<s>
Opponents
of
the
increase
argue
that
the
IMF
practices
central
planning
while
supporting
ineffective
governments
.
<s>
They
question
whether
the
IMF
has
any
role
in
developing
countries
,
given
its
original
mandate
to
assist
industrial
countries
in
balance-of-payments
emergencies
.
<s>
Opponents
show
that
there
are
already
more
funds
available
than
commendable
reform
efforts
.
<s>
They
worry
that
new
IMF
funding
of
developing
countries
will
simply
end
up
substituting
IMF
debt
for
reschedulable
commercial
bank
debt
,
a
bad
trade
all
around
.
<s>
They
believe
microeconomics
,
which
addresses
the
problems
of
markets
,
investment
climate
and
management
practices
,
is
the
key
to
developing-country
growth
,
not
the
IMF
's
Keynesian
focus
on
trade
deficits
,
quarterly
targets
and
government
debt
.
<s>
They
point
at
the
numerous
developing-country
governments
that
have
inflated
,
taxed
and
regulated
themselves
into
despair
under
successive
IMF
programs
.
<s>
Decisions
on
increases
in
the
IMF
's
capital
base
traditionally
are
made
by
the
administration
,
with
subsequent
authorization
by
Congress
.
<s>
The
last
U.S.
congressional
authorization
,
in
1983
,
was
a
political
donnybrook
and
carried
a
$
6
billion
housing
program
along
with
it
to
secure
adequate
votes
.
<s>
The
politics
of
the
1990
congressional
authorization
are
likely
to
be
similar
to
those
of
previous
authorizations
.
<s>
Liberals
may
support
the
stabilizing
,
quasi-governmental
role
of
the
IMF
on
two
conditions
:
that
the
administration
give
assurances
that
liberal
Democrats
'
support
will
not
be
used
against
them
in
congressional
re-election
campaigns
;
and
that
the
legislation
address
--
with
dollars
--
social
and
environmental
concerns
.
<s>
Conservative
Republicans
will
be
given
the
choice
of
supporting
or
fighting
their
party
's
popular
president
in
an
election
year
.
<s>
A
U.S.
decision
to
refuse
the
IMF
its
capital
increase
,
or
limit
it
to
25
%
,
would
bring
a
major
change
in
international
economic
policy
,
and
could
not
be
taken
lightly
.
<s>
Commentators
would
fret
over
the
implications
for
the
G-7
coordination
process
and
the
stability
of
world
financial
markets
.
<s>
Because
commercial
banks
and
the
developing-country
governments
believe
they
will
get
a
piece
of
any
capital
increase
,
a
scaled-down
IMF
mission
would
leave
both
feeling
shortchanged
.
<s>
Furthermore
,
a
U.S.
rejection
of
the
capital
increase
-LRB-
and
transfer
of
shares
to
Japan
-RRB-
would
give
Japan
an
argument
against
future
calls
for
economic
burden-sharing
.
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
a
decision
to
increase
the
IMF
's
capital
would
reinforce
the
central
economic
role
of
multilateral
institutions
in
developing
countries
.
<s>
With
the
increase
,
even
more
developing-country
energy
and
talent
would
be
diverted
from
creating
profitable
economic
systems
to
setting
up
economic
planning
ministries
that
generate
IMF-approved
economic
plans
.
<s>
Upping
the
ante
could
slow
economic
development
even
further
,
as
countries
delay
market-opening
steps
in
anticipation
of
richer
multilateral
support
.
<s>
Conservatives
should
take
a
position
prior
to
the
administration
's
year-end
deadline
.
<s>
The
issues
are
too
important
to
be
left

financial
and

ministries

size

rather
than
its
purpose

The
magazine
had
its
best
year
yet
in
1988
,
when
it
celebrated
its
centennial
and
racked
up
a
17
%
gain
in
ad
pages
,
to
283
.
<s>
But
this
year
,
when
the
hullabaloo
surrounding
its
centennial
died
,
so
too
did
some
advertiser
interest
.
<s>
The
reason
,
ad
executives
say
,
is
that
the
entire
magazine
business
has
been
soft
--
and
National
Geographic
has
some
quirks
that
make
it
especially
unattractive
during
a
soft
market
.
<s>
Perhaps
the
biggest
of
those
factors
is
its
high
ad
prices
--
$
130,000
for
a
four-color
page
,
vs.
$
47,000
for
the
Smithsonian
,
a
comparable
publication
with
a
far
smaller
circulation
.
<s>
When
ad
dollars
are
tight
,
the
high
page
cost
is
a
major
deterrent
for
advertisers
,
who
generally
want
to
appear
regularly
in
a
publication
or
not
at
all
.
<s>
Even
though
National
Geographic
offers
far
more
readers
than
does
a
magazine
like
Smithsonian
,
``
the
page
costs
you
an
arm
and
a
leg
to
develop
any
frequency
,
''
says
Harry
Glass
,
New
York
media
manager
for
Bozell
Inc
.
<s>
To
combat
that
problem
,
National
Geographic
,
like
other
magazines
,
began
offering
regional
editions
allowing
advertisers
to
appear
in
only
a
portion
of
its
magazines
--
for
example
,
ads
can
run
only
in
the
magazines
sent
to
subscribers
in
the
largest
25
markets
.
<s>
But
the
magazine
was
slower
than
its
competitors
to
come
up
with
its
regional
editions
,
and
until
last
year
offered
fewer
of
them
than
did
competitors
.
<s>
Time
magazine
,
for
example
,
has
more
than
100
separate
editions
going
to
different
regions
,
top
management
,
and
other
groups
.
<s>
Another
sticking
point
for
advertisers
was
National
Geographic
's
tradition
of
lumping
its
ads
together
,
usually
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
the
magazine
,
rather
than
spreading
ads
out
among
its
articles
,
as
most
magazines
do
.
<s>
And
National
Geographic
's
smaller-than-average
size
means
extra
production
costs
for
advertisers
.
<s>
But
Ms.
McCraw
says
the
magazine
is
fighting
back
.
<s>
It
now
offers
30
regional
editions
,
it
very
recently
began
running
ads
adjacent
to
articles
,
and
it
has
been
beefing
up
its
sales
force
.
<s>
And
it
just
launched
a
promotional
campaign
to
tell
chief
executives
,
marketing
directors
,
and
media
executives
just
that
.
<s>
The
centerpiece
of
the
promotion
is
its
new
ad
campaign
,
into
which
the
magazine
will
pour
about
$
500,000
,
mostly
in
the
next
few
weeks
.
<s>
The
campaign

created

The
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission
plans
to
restrict
dual
trading
on
commodity
exchanges
,
a
move
almost
certain
to
infuriate
exchange
officials
and
traders
.
<s>
The
CFTC
said
it
will
propose
the
restrictions
after
the
release
of
a
study
that
shows
little
economic
benefit
resulting
from
dual
trading
and
cites
``
problems
''
associated
with
the
practice
.
<s>
Dual
trading
gives
an
exchange
trader
the
right
to
trade
both
for
his
own
account
and
for
customers
.
<s>
The
issue
exploded
this
year
after
a
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
operation
led
to
charges
of
widespread
trading
abuses
at
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
and
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
.
<s>
While
not
specifically
mentioned
in
the
FBI
charges
,
dual
trading
became
a
focus
of
attempts
to
tighten
industry
regulations
.
<s>
Critics
contend
that
traders
were
putting
buying
or
selling
for
their
own
accounts
ahead
of
other
traders
'
customer
orders
.
<s>
Traders
are
likely
to
oppose
such
restrictions
because
dual
trading
provides
a
way
to
make
money
in
slower
markets
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
customer
orders
.
<s>
The
exchanges
contend
that
dual
trading
improves
liquidity
in
the
markets
because
traders
can
buy
or
sell
even
when
they
do
n't
have
a
customer
order
in
hand
.
<s>
The
exchanges
say
liquidity
becomes
a
severe
problem
for
thinly
traded
contracts
such
as
those
with
a
long
time
remaining
before
expiration
.
<s>
The
CFTC
may
take
those
arguments
into
account
by
allowing
exceptions
to
its
restrictions
.
<s>
The
agency
did
n't
cite
specific
situations
where
dual
trading
might
be
allowed
,
but
smaller
exchanges
or
contracts
that
need
additional
liquidity
are
expected
to
be
among
them
.

Wendy
Gramm

the
agency
's

told
the
Senate

Committee
that
she
expects
the
study
to
be
released
within
two
weeks
and
the
rule
changes
to
be
completed
by
Thanksgiving
.
<s>
The
study
,
by
the
CFTC
's
division
of
economic
analysis
,
shows
that
``
a
trade
is
a
trade
,
''
a
member
of
the
study
team
said
.
<s>
Whether
a
trade
is
done
on
a
dual
or
non-dual
basis
,
the
member
said
,
``
does
n't
seem
to
have
much
economic
impact
.
''
<s>
Currently
,
most
traders
on
commodity
exchanges
specialize
in
trading
either
for
customer
accounts
,
which
makes
them
brokers
,
or
for
their
own
accounts
as
socalled
locals
.
<s>
``
The
tests
indicate
that
dual
and
non-dual
traders
are
similar
in
terms
of
the
trade
executions
and
liquidity
they
provide
to
the
market
,
''
Mrs.
Gramm
told
the
Senate
panel
.
<s>
Members
of
Congress
have
proposed
restricting
dual
trading
in
bills
to
reauthorize
CFTC
operations
.
<s>
The
House
's
bill
would
prohibit
dual
trading
in
markets
with
daily
average
volume
of
7,000
contracts
or
more
,
comprising
those
considered
too
difficult
to
track
without

sophisticated

The
Senate
bill
would
force
the
CFTC
to
suspend
dual
trading
if
an
exchange
ca
n't
show
that
its
oversight
system
can
detect
dual-trading
abuses
.
<s>
So
far
,
one
test
of
restricting
dual
trading
has
worked
well

The
Chicago
Merc
banned
dual

During
the
Korean
War
,
Gen.
Douglas
MacArthur
demanded

got
,
in

his
U.N.
command
in
Korea
,
his
own
naval
command
in
Japan
,
NavforJapan
.
<s>
Those
obsolete
operations
cost
less
than
$
2
billion
a
year
,
and
keep
Mac
's
ghost
quiet
.
<s>
That
's
about
all
it
costs
to
appease
Adm.
Erich
Raeder
's
ghost
.
<s>
In
1941
,
Raeder
and
the
German
navy
threatened
to
attack
the
Panama
Canal
,
so
we
created
the
Southern
Command
in
Panama
.
<s>
The
Southern
Command
has
grown
even
bigger
since
the
war
because
Raeder
's
ghost
sometimes
runs
through
the
E
ring
dressed
like
Gen.
Noriega
.
<s>
The
Command
's
huge
bureaucracy
is
needed
to
analyze
whether
leaders
of
coups
against
Gen.
Noriega
meet
the
War
Powers
Act
's
six
points
,
Cap
Weinberger
's
seven
points
,
the
Intelligence
Committee
's
32
points
and
Woodrow
Wilson
's
14
points
necessary
to
justify
U.S.
support

So
far
no
one
has
.
<s>
The
ghost
of
the
Soviet
brigade
discovered
in
Cuba
back
in
the
'70s
costs
just
a
few
hundred
million
:
the
price
of
the
Caribbean
Command
in
Key
West
that
President
Carter
created
in
1980
.
<s>
The
brigade
has
n't
been
heard
from
since
,

we
keep
the
staff
around
just
in

<s>
George
Marshall
's
ghost
is
much
more
difficult
to
keep
happy
.
<s>
We
keep
a
lot
of
shrines
to
him
around
the
Pentagon
:
statues
,
busts
,
relics
and
such
.
<s>
The
Army
headquarters
on
the
third
deck
of
the
Pentagon
used
to
burn
a
lot
of
incense
to
him
,
but
the
Navy
headquarters
on
the
fourth
deck
made
them
stop
it
.
<s>
You
see
,
Marshall
had
this
thing
about
the
Navy
and
the
Marines
--
he
wanted
to
make
them
part
of
the
Army
but
Secretary
of
the
Navy
James
Forrestal
blocked
him
.
<s>
Now
his
ghost
wo
n't
let
up
till
it
's
done
.
<s>
To
keep
him
quiet
we
invent
a
new
unified
command
every
year
or
so
run
by
the
Army
or
the
Air
Force
and
put
more
of
the
Navy
and
Marines
under
it
.
<s>
But
we
still
hear
him
moaning
at
night
because
the
Navy
has
a
few
ships
left
,
and
to
satisfy
him
the
Navy
's
sea
lift
forces
were
given
to
a
new
Air
Force
bureaucracy
in
Illinois
,
its
space
operations
to
another
command
in
Colorado
,
the
frogmen
to
a
new
Army
bureaucracy
in
Fort
Bragg
,
and
the
Navy
's
Indian
Ocean
and
Persian
Gulf
forces
to
an
Army
bureaucracy
in
Florida
.
<s>
Which
brings
up
the
worst
and
meanest
ghost
of
all
--
the
ghost
of
the
shah
of
Iran
.
<s>
When
the
shah
died
,
President
Carter
was
so
scared
that
the
shah
's
ghost
would
blame
him
for
shoving
him
out
to
make
way
for
the
ayatollah
that
he
declared
the
Carter
Doctrine
.
<s>
Mr.
Carter
said
he
would
go
to
war
to
stop
anyone
from
trying
to
grab
Iran
.
<s>
But
that
ghost
would
n't
settle
for
words
,
he
wanted
money
and
people
--
lots
.
<s>
So
Mr.
Carter
formed
three
new
Army
divisions
and
gave
them
to
a
new
bureaucracy
in
Tampa
called
the
Rapid
Deployment
Force
.
<s>
But
that
ghost
was
n't
fooled
;
he
knew
the
RDF
was
neither
rapid
nor
deployable
nor
a
force
--
even
though
it
cost
$
8
billion
or
$
10
billion
a
year
.
<s>
After
Mr.
Carter
was
defeated
in
1980
,
the
shah
's
ghost
claimed
the
credit
and
then
went
after
President
Reagan
and
Cap
Weinberger
.
<s>
I
saw
what
he
did
to
them
firsthand
.
<s>
It
made
my
shoelaces
dance
with
terror
.
<s>
Why
,
he
used
to
lay
in
wait
for
Cap
;
suddenly
he
'd
leap
from
behind
some
statue
of
Marshall
onto
Cap
's
chest
and
grab
him
by
the
throat
and
choke
him
till
he
coughed
up
an
additional
$
2
billion
or
so
.
<s>
Cap
added
four
more
divisions
to
the
Army
,
two
active
and
two
reserve
;
two
carrier
groups
to
the
Navy
;
a
division
--
equivalent
to
the
Marines
;
and
the
C-5B
,
KC-10
,
C-17
and
a
thousand
tactical
aircraft
to
the
Air
Force
.
<s>
He
bought
$
4
billion
in
prepositioning
ships
and
$
7
billion
in
ammo
and
equipment
to
fill
them
,
and
parked
them
at
a
new
$
6
billion
base
at
Diego
Garcia
in
the
middle
of
the
Indian
Ocean
.
<s>
He
dedicated
all
these
new
forces
to
the
Persian
Gulf
.
<s>
One
night
both
Marshall
's
ghost
and
the
shah
's
ghost
together
caught
Cap
and
threw
him
to
the
ground
.
<s>
Before
they
let
him
go
he
added
a
thousand
bureaucrats
to
the
RDF
in
Tampa
and
renamed
it
Central
Command
.
<s>
He
gave
those
bureaucrats
charge
of
all
naval
operations
in
the
Persian
Gulf
and
Indian
Ocean
.
<s>
Marshall
figured
it
would
be
good
training
for
those
soldiers
--
someday
maybe
they
would
get
the
whole
Navy
.
<s>
They
had
fun
moving
the
carriers
around
,
but
it
turned
out
that
they
had
forgotten
all
about
mine
sweepers
.
<s>
But
the
shah
still
kept
leaping
out
at
Cap
,
so
Cap
bought
a
hundred
merchant
ships
more
and
$
7
billion
of
loading
barges
,
ramps
,
etc.
,
in
order
that
those
seven
new
Army
divisions
and
three
Marine
brigades
could
unload
from
all
those
new
ships
and
aircraft
and
go
to
war
in
the
Zagros
mountains
.
<s>
Then
suddenly
Ike
's
ghost
came
to
visit
and
said
,
``
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
planning
for
a
land
war

Asia

away

We
'd

kicked

Lucky
for
Cap
,
Ike
was
easygoing
and
soon
went
away
,
while
the
shah
--
he
kept
coming
back
.
<s>
So
the
U.S.
found
itself
paying
about
$
2
billion
in
baksheesh
to
various
Arab
potentates
for
basing
rights
around

Indian
Ocean
.

We
had
great
success
in

But
then
it
turned
out
that
President
Siad
Barrah
was
not
at
all
a
nice
person
and
the
Navy
pointed
out
that
the
base
he
promised
us
in
Berbera
had
silted
up
about
a
hundred
years
ago
and
anyway
was
1,244

Still
,
Berbera
was
the

we
could
get

All

reports
about

have
positioned

Meanwhile

Congress
is
cutting
huge
chunks
out

Predictably
,
some
Navy

said
:
``

told
him

So
next
day
Mr.
Cheney
went
out
and
did
just
that
:
He
canceled
the
600-ship
Navy
and
cut
back
one
carrier
and
20
frigates
.

Then
he
canceled
production

carrier
aircraft

the

an

baroque
canvas
painted

At

engulfed

flamboyant
chairman

chief
executive
,
David
L.
Paul

<s>
In
an

By

office
regulates

state
's
S&Ls

<s>
CenTrust
did
n't
meet
the
deadline

<s>
The
collection
was
at
the
heart
of
a
grandiose
plan
Mr.
Paul
had
in
which
the
art
was
to
do
double
duty
--
as
an
investment
for
CenTrust
and
as
decoration
for
the
S&L

new
office
tower

designed
by

The
rub
is
that

plucked
from

funds

this
federally
insured
institution

some
visions

Mr.

ideas

First
,
he
suggests
,
GPA
Group
Ltd.
,
the
international
aircraft
leasing
company
based
in
Ireland
,
could
lease
some
of
its
Boeing
jetliners
to
the
Soviet
airline
.
<s>
Then
Aer
Lingus
,
the
Irish
flag
carrier
,
could
teach
Aeroflot
pilots
to
fly
the
Boeings
,
and
the
fleet
could
be
based
here
at
Shannon
Airport
.
<s>
That
's
not
all
,
he
says
.
<s>
Aer
Rianta
,
the
Irish
airport
authority
,
could
build
a
cargo
terminal
in
the
Soviet
Union
.
<s>
Aeroflot
could
lease
some
of
its
cargo
planes
to
Aer
Lingus
,
through
GPA
,
for
a
joint-venture
cargo
airline
.
<s>
And
then
there
is
his
notion
of
an
Irish-Soviet
charter
airline
to
ferry
Armenians
to
Los
Angeles
via
Shannon
.
<s>
Have
the
freedoms
of
glasnost
gone
to
Mr.
Ovcharenko
's
head
?
<s>
Hardly
.
<s>
The
Irish-Soviet
aviation
connection
is
alive
and
well
here
at
Shannon
Airport
.
<s>
GPA
is
indeed
talking
about
leasing
Western
planes
to
Aeroflot
and
even
about
buying
Soviet-built
Tupolev
204s
.
<s>
Aer
Lingus
is
in
discussions
with
the
Soviet
carrier
about
a
cargo
venture
and
other
possibilities
.
<s>
Aer
Rianta
already
has
so
many
ventures
with
Aeroflot
that
its
chief
executive
is
studying
Russian
.
<s>
Unlikely
as
it
may
seem
,
tiny
,
politically
neutral
Ireland
has
penetrated
the
mighty
Soviet
airline
bureaucracy
.
<s>
And
as
Aeroflot
struggles
to
boost
its
service
standards
,
upgrade
its
fleet
and
pursue
commercial
opportunities
,
the
Irish
aviation
industry
seems
poised
to
benefit
.
<s>
``
Irish
and
Soviet
people
are
similar
,
''
says
Mr.
Ovcharenko
.
<s>
``
They
look

They
're

<s>
Moreover
,
he
says
,
Irish

are
small

spunky

``

have
to
study

experience
very
well

''
he
says
.

``
We
must
find
any
way

get
business

<s>
The
two
groups
have
been
working
together

late
1970s

Latvian
port
of
Ventspils
each
year
unload
25
million
gallons
of
fuel
into

<s>
What
Aeroflot
does

pour
into
its

authority
,
which
resells
it
to
11
Western
carriers
including
Air
France
,

World
Airlines

<s>
Aeroflot
thus
pays

ground-handling

bills
with
fuel
,
preserving
its
hard
currency
.
<s>
That
is
n't
all
.

Last

Advances
in

fuel
efficiency
over

years
made

unnecessary

Aeroflot
still
flies
inefficient
Ilyushins
that
ca
n't
make
it
from
Moscow
to
Managua
on
one
hop

<s>
As
a
result
,

did
n't
spurn
the
Soviets

shot
down
a
Korean
Air
Lines
jetliner
over
the
Sea

Japan

The

yes

compelling

Currently

to
preserve

safety

fitness

period

%

more
of

stock

intent

The
bill
would
allow

secretary
to
reject

sufficient
information
has

been
provided

if
the
buy-out
is

to
weaken

financially

substantial
reduction
in
size

All
the
witnesses

that

calm

enter

discourage

there
is
also
the
possibility

shutting
down

will
intensify
fears

focused

additional

In

To
the
extent
that

the

is
that

If

Even

Mr.

If
this

Mr.

said
the

already
had
some
good
price-supporting
technical
factors
that
would
have
caused

rise

with

without

``
What

market
did
was
cause

said
Mr.
Cardillo

<s>
There
's
a
good
chance

will
retain
its
gains
and
rise
further

he
said
.
<s>
He
expects
a
drop
in
interest
rates
,
which
would
help
gold
by
keeping
the
dollar
from
rising
.
<s>
Finally
,
according
to
Mr.
Cardillo
,
the
impact
of
the
strong
dollar
should
be
reflected
in
reduced
exports
in
the
August
merchandise
trade
deficit
,
when
the
figures

<s>
This
would
be
damaging

supportive
for

.
<s>
ENERGY
:
<s>
Worried
that
Friday

190-point

market
plunge
might
be
a
harbinger
of
things
to
come

economy

petroleum
futures
traders
called
a
halt
to

recent
string
of
increases
in

oil
futures
prices
.
<s>
The
U.S.
benchmark
crude
,
West
Texas
Intermediate
,
closed
at
$
20.59
a
barrel
for
November
delivery
,
down
30
cents
.
<s>
Some
analysts
said
crude
was
due
for
a
correction
anyhow
,
following
several
days
of
significant
gains
.
<s>
But
most
market
observers
agreed
that
Friday

stock
market
drop
is
what
dampened
spirits
in
the
petroleum
pits
yesterday

<s>
Until
yesterday

indicator

after

sharply

bounced
back
strongly
to

thus
easing
fears
that
foreigners
would
unload
U.S.

And
the
widely
disseminated
opinion

Still
,
amid

cautioned

built
up

$

.
<s>
One
reason
is
that
after
two

the
fund
posted
net

money
from

<s>
Also
,
persistent
redemptions
would
force
some
fund
managers
to
dump
stocks

raise
cash
.
<s>
But
a
strong
level
of
investor
withdrawals
is
much
more
unlikely
this
time
around

fund
managers

A
major
reason
is
that

Stock-fund

haul

across

peaks

troughs

Quantum

prosper

much
broader

better
cushioned
against
price
swings

When

Quantum

annual
profit
fluctuates
by
about
85
cents

In

building
block

badly

Calculating

polyethylene
would
soon
be
sloshing
around

other
buyers
then
bet

had
peaked

so
began

draw
down
inventories

order
new
product

Kenneth

For

88
years

Every
indication
is
that
the
four
are
prepared
to
accept
this
new
role
,
and
the
frustrations
that
go
with
it
,
but
in
different
ways
.
<s>
Justices
Brennan
and
Stevens
appear
philosophical
about
it
;
Justices
Marshall
and
Blackmun
appear
fighting
mad
.
<s>
The
four
justices
are
no
newcomers
to
dissent
,
often
joining
forces
in
the
past
decade
to
criticize
the
court
's
conservative
drift
.
<s>
But
always
,
in
years
past
,
they
have
bucked
the
trend
and
have
been
able
to
pick
up
a
fifth

eke
out

major
victories

Now
,
however
,
as
the
court
's
new
five-member
conservative
majority
continues

solidify
,
victories
for
the
liberals
are
rare
.
<s>
The
change
is
most
dramatic
for
Justice
Brennan
,
the
last
survivor
of
the
mid-1960s
liberal
majority
under
Chief
Justice
Earl
Warren
.
<s>
In
the
seven
Supreme
Court
terms
from

fall
of
1962
through
the
spring
of
1967
,
the
height
of
the
Warren
Court
's
power

Justice
Brennan
cast
only
25
dissenting
votes
in
555
cases
decided
by
the
court
.
<s>
Last
term
alone
he
cast
52
dissenting
votes

133
decisions
,
with
the
contentious
flag-burning
ruling
as
his
only
big
victory
.

Brennan
foresaw

new
role

strongly
defending

importance
of
dissents

1985
speech

<s>
``
Each
time

reconsider

questions

rethink
the
result

said

Moreover
,
in
recent
months
he
has
said
that
when

was

side

he
knew
that
the
tables
might
turn

of
81-year-old
Justice
Marshall
say
he
was
``
depressed
''
about
the
court
's
direction
last
spring

is
feisty
about
his
role

determined
to
speak
out
against

court

cutbacks
in
civil
rights

he
said
in

speech
last
month

<s>
He
,
like
Justice
Brennan
,
considers
dissents
highly
important
for
the
future
,
a
point
that
has
n't
escaped
legal
scholars
.
<s>
Harvard
Law
School
Professor
Laurence
Tribe
says
there
is
a
``
generation-skipping
''
flavor
to
current
dissents
.
<s>
The
dissenters
in
the
Warren
Court
,
he
says
,
appeared
to
be
writing
for
the
short-term
,
suggesting
that
the
court
's
direction
might
change
soon
.
<s>
``
Brennan
and
Marshall
are
speaking
in
their
dissents
to
a
more
distant
future

''
he
says
.
<s>
Justice
Blackmun
,
who
will
turn
81
next
month
,
also
seems
feisty
about
his
new
role
.
<s>
Associates
say
he
takes
some
defeats
more
personally
than
his
colleagues
,
especially
attempts
to
curtail
the
right
to
abortion
first
recognized
in
his
1973
opinion
,
Roe
vs.
Wade
.
<s>
Friends
and
associates
who
saw
Justice
Blackmun
during
the
summer
said
he
was
no
more
discouraged
about
the
court
than
in
recent
years
.
<s>
And
his
outlook
improved
after
successful
cataract
surgery
in
August
.
<s>
But
his
level
of
frustration
showed
in
a
recent
,
impassioned
speech
to
a
group
of
hundreds
of
lawyers
in
Chicago
.
<s>
He
concluded
his
remarks
by
quoting
,
emotionally
and
at
some
length
,
according
to
those
present
,
the
late
Martin
Luther
King
's
famous
``
I
Have
a
Dream
''
speech
from
the
1963
March
on
Washington
.
<s>
Justice
Stevens
,
69
,
is
probably
the
most
philosophical
of
the
dissenters
about
his
role
,
in
part
because
he
may
be
the
least
liberal
of
the
four
,
but
also
because
he
enjoys
the
intellectual
challenge
of
arguing
with
the
majority
more
than
the
others
.

If
the
role
these
four
dissenters
are
assuming
is
a
familiar
one

To
distinguish

CNN

outward

The

typically
is
the
humor
of

it
was
perfected
by
both

In

wielded

it

a
constructive
form
of
mischief
.

Why
constructive
?
<s>
Because
despite
all
the
media
prattle
about
comedy
and
politics
not
mixing
,
they
are
similar
in
one
respect
:
Both
can
serve
as
mechanisms
for
easing
tensions
and
facilitating
the
co-existence
of
groups
in
conflict
.

That
's
why
it
's
dangerous
to
have
well-intentioned
thought
police
,
on

,
taboo
all
critical
mention
of
group
differences

<s>
As
Elizabeth

wrote
in

``
Perhaps

not
boil

The
question
is
,
if
group
conflicts
still
exist
-LRB-
as
undeniably
they
do
-RRB-
,
and
if
Mr.
Mason
's
type
of
ethnic
humor
is
passe
,
then
what
other
means
do
we
have
for
letting
off
steam
?
<s>
Do
n't
say
the
TV
sitcom
,
because
that
happens
to
be
a
genre
that
,
in
its
desperate
need
to
attract
everybody
and
offend
nobody
,
resembles
politics
more
than
it
does
comedy
.
<s>
It
is
true
that
the
best
sitcoms
do
allow
group
differences
to
simmer
:
yuppies
vs.
blue-collar
Bostonians
in
``
Cheers
''
;
children
vs.
adults
in
``
The
Cosby
Show
.
''
<s>
But
these
are
not
the
differences
that
make
headlines
.
<s>
In
``
Chicken
Soup
,
''
Mr.
Mason
plays
Jackie
,
a
Jewish
bachelor
courting
Maddie
-LRB-
Lynn
Redgrave
-RRB-
,
an
Irish
widow
and
mother
of
three

against
the
wishes
of
his
mother
-LRB-
Rita
Karin
-RRB-
and
her
brother
Michael
-LRB-
Brandon
Maggart
-RRB-
.
<s>
It
's
worth
noting
that
both
disapproving
relatives
are
immigrants
.
<s>
At
least
,
they
both
speak
with
strong
accents
,
as
do
Jackie
and
Maddie
.
<s>
It
could
n't
be
more
obvious
that
``
Chicken
Soup
''
is
being
made
from
an
old
recipe
.
<s>
And
a
safe
one
--
imagine
if
the
romance
in
question
were
between
an
Orthodox
Jew
and
a
member
of
the
Nation
of
Islam
.
<s>
Back
in
the
1920s
,
the
play
and
movie
versions
of
``
Abie
's
Irish
Rose
''
made
the
theme
of
courtship
between
the
assimilated
offspring
of
Jewish
and
Irish
immigrants
so
popular
that
its
author
,
Anne
Nichols
,
lost
a
plagiarism
suit
on
the
grounds
that
the
plot
has
entered
the
public
domain
.
<s>
And
it
has
remained
there
,
as
evidenced
by
its
reappearance
in
a
1972
CBS
sitcom
called
``
Bridget
Loves
Bernie
,
''
whose
sole
distinction
was
that
it
led
to
the
real-life
marriage
of
Meredith
Baxter
and
David
Birney
.
<s>
Clearly
,
the
question
with
``
Chicken
Soup
''
is
not
whether
the
pot
will
boil
over
,
but
whether
it
will
simmer
at
all
.
<s>
So
far
,
the
bubbles
have
been
few
and
far
between
.
<s>
Part
of
the
problem
is
the
tendency
of
all
sitcoms
,
ever
since
the
didactic
days
of
Norman
Lear
,
to
preach
about
social
issues
.
<s>
To
some
extent
,
this
tendency
emerges
whenever
the
show
tries
to
enlighten
us
about
ethnic
stereotypes
by
reversing
them
.
<s>
For
instance
,
Michael
dislikes
Jackie
not
because
he
's
a
shrewd
Jewish
businessman
,
but
because
he
quits
his
well-paying
job
as
a
salesman
in
order
to
become
a
social
worker
.
<s>
Even
more
problematic
is
the
incompatibility
between
sitcom
preachiness
and
Mr.
Mason
's
comic
persona
.
<s>
The
best
moments
in
the
show
occur
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
-LRB-
and
occasionally
in
the
middle
-RRB-
,
when
Mr.
Mason
slips
into
his
standup
mode
and
starts
meting
out
that
old-fashioned
Jewish
mischief
to
other
people
as
well
as
to
himself
.
<s>
But
too
often
,
these
routines
lack
spark
because
this
sitcom
,
like
all
sitcoms
,
is
timid
about
confronting
Mr.
Mason
's
stock
in
trade
-
ethnic
differences
.
<s>
I
'm
not
suggesting
that
the
producers
start
putting
together
episodes
about
topics
like
the
Catholic-Jewish
dispute
over
the
Carmelite
convent
at
Auschwitz
.
<s>
That
issue
,
like
racial
tensions
in
New
York
City
,
will
have
to
cool
down
,
not
heat
up
,
before
it
can
simmer
.
<s>
But
I
am
suggesting
that
they
stop
requiring
Mr.
Mason
to
interrupt
his
classic
shtik
with
some
line
about
``
caring
for
other
people
''
that
would
sound
shmaltzy
on
the
lips
of
Miss
America

Unlike

the
economy

The

is
not
the

of
Mr.

I

the

I
disagree
with
the
statement
by
Mr.
Lantos
that
one
should
not
draw
an
adverse
inference
against
former
HUD
officials
who
assert
their
Fifth
Amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
congressional
hearings
.
<s>
The
Fifth
Amendment
states
in
relevant
part
that
no
person
``
shall
be
compelled
,
in
any
criminal
case
,
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
.
''
<s>
This
privilege
against
self-incrimination
precludes
the
drawing
of
an
adverse
inference
against
a
criminal
defendant
who
chooses
not
to
testify
.
<s>
Thus
,
in
a
criminal
case
,
a
prosecutor
can
not
comment
on
a
defendant
's
failure
to
testify
nor
can
the
defendant
be
compelled
to
take
the
stand
as
a
witness
,
thus
forcing
him
to
``
take
the
Fifth
.
''
<s>
The
privilege
,
however
,
has
been
limited
in
accordance
with
its
plain
language
to
protect
the
defendant
in
criminal
matters
only
.
<s>
The
Supreme
Court
and
some
states
have
specifically
recognized
that
``
the
Fifth
Amendment
does
not
preclude
the
inference
where
the
privilege
is
claimed
by
a
party
to
a
civil
cause

<s>
Thus
,
in
a
civil
case
,
a
defendant
may
be
called
as
a
witness
,
he
may
be
forced
to
testify
or
take
the
Fifth
,
and
his
taking
of
the
Fifth
may
permit
the
drawing
of
an
adverse
inference
against
him
in
the
civil
matter
.
<s>
He
may
take
the
Fifth
in
a
civil
matter
only
if
he
has
a
good
faith
and
justifiable
belief
that
his
testimony
may
subject
him
to
criminal
prosecution
.
<s>
Allowing
the
defendant
to
take
the
Fifth
in
a
civil
matter
is
not
based
on
a
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
testify
where
one
's
testimony
harms
him
in
the
civil
matter
,
but
because
the
testimony
in
the
civil
matter
could
be
unconstitutionally
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
.
<s>
Absent
the
risk
of
such
prosecution
,
a
court
may
order
the
defendant
to
testify
.
<s>
Thus
,
when
Mr.
Pierce
asserted
the
Fifth
in
a
noncriminal
proceeding
,
particularly
after
presumably
receiving
extensive
advice
from
legal
counsel
,
one
must
conclude
that
he
held
a
good-faith
,
justifiable
belief
that
his
testimony
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
.
<s>
The
subcommittee
,
Congress
and
the
American
public
have
every
right
to
draw
the
adverse
inference
and
to
concur
with
Mr.
Pierce
's
own
belief
that
his
testimony
could
help
convict
him
of
a
crime
.
<s>
Drawing
the
adverse
inference
in
a
noncriminal
congressional
hearing
does
not
offend
the
Fifth
Amendment
shield
against
self-incrimination

''
<s>
--
The
administration
has
sent
out
confusing
signals
about
its
response
to
a
recent
spate
of
airline
takeovers
.
<s>
Last
month
,
Transportation
Secretary
Sam
Skinner
forced
Northwest
Airlines
to
reduce
a
stake
held
by
KLM
Royal
Dutch
Airlines
.
<s>
But
he
has
since
run
into
opposition
from
the
Treasury
and
the
White
House
over
that
decision
.
<s>
And
he
has
kept
mum
on
how
his
decision
might
affect
a
bid
for
United
Airlines
,
which
includes
a
big
stake
by
British
Airways
PLC
.
<s>
Some
analysts
say
uncertainty
about
Washington
's
anti-takeover
policy
was
one
reason
that
financing
for
the
United
Airlines
takeover
fell
through
--
the
event
that
triggered
the
market
drop
.
<s>
In
many
ways
,
the
backdrop
to
Friday
's
stock
decline
is
eerily
similar
to
that
of
October
1987
's
508-point
crash
.
<s>
Then
,
as
now
,
the
budget
debate
was
behind
schedule
and
automatic
spending
cuts
were
within
days
of
taking
hold
.
<s>
The
Treasury
was
locked
in
a
battle
over
international
economic
policy
,
although
at
that
time
it
was
with
West
German
officials
rather
than
the
Federal
Reserve
.
<s>
And
concern
about
official
actions
aimed
at
takeovers
--
then
by
the
tax-writing
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
rather
than
the
Transportation
Department
--
were
making
markets
nervous
.
<s>
The
1987
crash
brought
the
Reagan
administration
and
Democratic
lawmakers
to
the
table
for
the
first
budget
summit
,
resulting
in
a
two-year
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
$
76
billion
--
even
though
the
deficit
actually
rose
by
nearly
$
12
billion
during
that
period
.
<s>
But
,
barring
further
drops
in
the
market
this
week
,
a
similar
outcome
does
n't
seem
likely
this
year
.
<s>
Lawmakers
and
administration
officials
agree
that
Friday
's
drop
,
by
itself
,
is
n't
enough
to
force
both
sides
back
to
the
table
to
try
to
reach
a
deficit-reduction
agreement
that
would
be
more
serious
and
more
far-reaching
than
last
spring
's
gimmick-ridden
plan
,
which
still
is
n't
fully
implemented
.
<s>
One
of
the
biggest
reasons
that
new
talks
are
n't
likely
to
come
about
is
that
,
as
everyone
learned
in
1987
,
the
economy
and
the
market
can
survive
a
one-day
508-point
tumble
.
<s>
``
Everybody

''
<s>
But
administration
officials
privately
agree
with
Mr.
Panetta
,
who
said
a
precipitous
drop
this
week
``
is
going
to
force
the
president
and
Congress
to
take
a
much
harder
look
at
fiscal
policy
.
''
<s>
In
that
case
,
there
will
be
plenty
of
blame
to
go
around
.
<s>
``
There
is
an
underlying
concern
on
the
part
of
the
American
people
--
and
there
should
be
-
that
the
administration
has
not
gone
far
enough

That

the
case
in

was
so
weak
that
some
economists

officials
seriously
worried
that

might
collapse
,
producing
panic
among

diminishing

Another
big
difference
between
1987

1989
is
n't
so
comforting
.

In
the
third
quarter
of
1987
,
the
economy
spurted
at
an
inflation-adjusted
annual
rate
of
5.3
%
.

The

that

a

more
sluggish
2.3

What
's
more

Mr.

notes

The
more
a
company
relies
on
borrowed
money
,
the
greater
its
sensitivity
to
an
economic
slowdown
.
<s>
A
company
with
a
strong
balance
sheet
can
withstand
an
unanticipated
storm
;
a
highly
leveraged
company
may
end
up
in
bankruptcy
court
.
<s>
The
Fed
,
of

,
knows
that
very
well

hence
its
readiness
to
pump
credit
into
the
economy
this
morning
.
<s>
But
,
in
the
process
,
the
Fed
risks
reigniting
inflation
.
<s>
Even
before
Friday
's
events
,
Harvard
University
economist
Benjamin
Friedman
was
arguing
that
the
Fed
wo
n't
be
able
to
live
up
to
its
tough
words
on
eliminating
inflation
because
of
its
responsibility
to
protect
fragile
financial
markets
,
banks
and
highly
leveraged
corporations
.
<s>
The
biggest
threat
on
the
economic
horizon
right
now
is
n't
recession
,
he
reasons
;
it
's
an
outbreak
of
uncontrolled
inflation
.
<s>
In
the
end
,
the
1987
collapse
suggested
,
the
economy
does
n't
move
in
lockstep
with
stock
prices
.
<s>
The
economy
does
,
however
,
depend
on
the
confidence
of
businesses
,
consumers
and
foreign
investors
.
<s>
A
panic
on
Wall
Street
does
n't
exactly
inspire
confidence
.
<s>
Surveys
suggested
that
consumer
confidence
was
high
before
Friday
.
<s>
A
190-point
drop
is
n't
likely
to
make
much
of
a
dent
;
multiply
that
a
few
times
over
,

it
will

If
the

gathered
Saturday
at

business
leaders
were

overly
rattled

And
if
foreign
investors
become
a

more
cautious
--
well
,
the
dollar
's
recent
strength
suggests
that
the
U.S.
can
stand
it
.
<s>
On
the
bottom
line
,
the
most

that

quarter

Those
of

obligation

still
the
true
long-term
aim

many
national-service
backers

contain
no
coercion

Choice
of
the
volunteer
military

1970s

to
doom
national
service
as

draft

But
the
virus
was
kept
alive
in
sociology
departments

couple
of
years
ago

it
again
was
let
loose

<s>
This
time
it
attempted
to
invade
two
connected
problems

the
rising
cost
of
higher
education
and
the
rising
expense
to
the
federal
government
of
educational
grants
and
loans
.
<s>
Why
not
keep
and
even
expand
the
loans
and
grants

the
advocates
reasoned

require
some
form
of
service
from
each
recipient
?

Military
service
,
moreover

could
be
a
national-service
option

Thus

undoubtedly
it
was
hoped
that
the
new
strain
of
national
service
would
prove
contagious
,
infecting
patriotic
conservatives
,
pay-as-you-go
moderates
,
and
idealistic
liberals
.
<s>
The
Democratic
Leadership
Council
,
a
centrist
group
sponsoring

plan
,
surely
thought
it
might
help
the
party
to
attract
support
,
especially
among
college
students
and
their
parents
.

A
provision
allowing
grants
to
be
applied

first-home
purchases

added
to
appeal

had
had
enough
of
schooling

100

free

With
a
tax-free
$
10,000
voucher
payment

wage
comparable

you

better

supporting
families

As
it
happened

political
resistance
developed
among
educational

minority
interests
that
count
on

grant
system

supposedly
crucial

Opposition
to
national
service
from
the
Pentagon

People
eager
to
have
youth
``
pay

favor
service
proposals
--
preferably
mandatory
ones
.
<s>
So
do
those
who
seek
a
``
re-energized
concept
of
citizenship
,
''
a
concept
imposing
stern
obligations
as
well
as
conferring
rights
.
<s>
Then
there
are
instinctive
opponents
.
<s>
To
libertarians
,
mandatory
service
is
an
abomination

voluntary
systems
are
illegitimate
uses

perform

If

market
wo

they
argue
,
it
ca
n't
be
worth
its
cost

<s>
Elements
of
the
left
are
also
reflexively
opposed
;
they
see
service
as
a
cover
for
the
draft
,
or
fear
the
regimentation
of
youth
,

want

what
about

us
whose

are

How
should
we
think
about
national
service
?
<s>
Let
's
begin
by
recognizing
a
main
source
of
confusion
--
``
national
service
''
has
no
agreed
meaning
.
<s>
Would
service
be
voluntary
or
compulsory
?
<s>
Short
or
long
?
<s>
Part-time
or
full-time
?
<s>
Paid
or
unpaid
?
<s>
Would
participants
live
at
home
and
work
nearby
or
live
in
barracks
and
work
on
public
lands
?
<s>
What
kinds
of
work
would
they
do
?
<s>
What
does
``
national
''
mean
?
<s>
Would
the
program
be
run
by
the
federal
government
,
by
local
governments
,
or
by
private
voluntary
organizations
?
<s>
And
who
would
serve
?
<s>
Only
males
,
as
with
the
draft
,
or
both
sexes
?
<s>
Youth
only
or
all
ages
?
<s>
Middle-class
people
,
or
poor
people
,
or
a
genuine
cross-section
?
<s>
Many
or
few
?
<s>
Those
are
not
trivial
questions
,
and
the
label
``
national
service
''
answers
none
of
them
.
<s>
Then
how
should
we
think
about
national
service
?
<s>
As
a
starting
point
,
here
are
five
propositions
:
1
.
Consider
the
ingredients
,
not
the
name
.
<s>
Ignore
``
national
service
''
in
the
abstract
;
consider
specific
proposals
.
<s>
They
will
differ
in
crucial
ways
.
<s>
2
.
``
Service
''
should
be
service
.
<s>
As
commonly
understood
,
service
implies
sacrifice
.
<s>
It
involves
accepting
risk
,
or
giving
up
income
,
or
deferring
a
career
.
<s>
It
follows
that
proposals
like
Nunn-McCurdy
,
whose
benefits
to
enrollees
are
worth
some
$
17,500
a
year
,
do
not
qualify
.
<s>
There
is
a
rationale
for
such
bills
:
Federal
subsidies
to
college
students
amount
to
``
a
GI
Bill
without
the
GI
''
;
arguably
those
benefits
should
be
earned
,
not
given
.
<s>
But
the
earnings
exceed
by
20
%
the
average
income
of
young
high-school
graduates
with
full-time
jobs
.
<s>
Why
call
that
service
?
<s>
3
.
Encouragement
is
fine
;
compulsion
is
not
.
<s>
Compelled
service
is
unconstitutional
.
<s>
It
is
also
unwise
and
unenforceable
.
<s>
-LRB-
Who
will
throw
several
hundred
thousand
refusers
in
jail
each
year
?
-RRB-
<s>
But
through
tax
policy
and
in
other
ways
the
federal
government
encourages
many
kinds
of
behavior
.
<s>
It
should
also
encourage
service
--
preferably
by
all
classes
and
all
ages
.
<s>
Its
encouragement
should
strengthen
and
not
undercut
the
strong
tradition
of
volunteering
in
the
U.S.
,
should
build
on
the
service
programs
already
in
existence
,
and
should
honor
local
convictions
about
which
tasks
most
need
doing
.
<s>
4
.
Good
programs
are
not
cheap
.
<s>
Enthusiasts
assume
that
national
service
would
get
important
work
done
cheaply
:
forest
fires
fought
,
housing
rehabilitated
,
students
tutored
,
day-care
centers
staffed
.
<s>
There
is
important
work
to
be
done
,
and
existing
service
and
conservation
corps
have
shown
that
even
youths
who
start
with
few
skills
can
do
much
of
it
well
--
but
not
cheaply
.
<s>
Good
service
programs
require
recruitment
,
screening
,
training
and
supervision
--
all
of
high
quality
.
<s>
They
involve
stipends
to
participants
.
<s>
Full-time
residential
programs
also
require
housing
and
full-time
supervision
;
they
are
particularly
expensive
--
more
per
participant
than
a
year
at
Stanford
or
Yale
.
<s>
Non-residential
programs
are
cheaper
,
but
good
ones
still
come
to
some
$
10,000
a
year
.
<s>
Are
they
worth
that
?
<s>
Evaluations
suggest
that
good
ones
are
--
especially
so
if
the
effects
on
participants
are
counted
.
<s>
But
the
calculations
are
challengeable
.
<s>
5
.
Underclass
youth
are
a
special
concern
.
<s>
Are
such
expenditures
worthwhile
,
then
?
<s>
Yes
,
if
targeted
.
<s>
People
of
all
ages
and
all
classes
should
be
encouraged
to
serve
,
but
there
are
many
ways
for
middle-class
kids
,
and
their
elders
,
to
serve
at
little
public
cost
.
<s>
They
can
volunteer
at
any
of
thousands
of
non-profit
institutions
,
or
participate
in
service
programs
required
by
high
schools
or
encouraged
by
colleges
or
employers
.
<s>
Underclass
youth
do
n't
have
those
opportunities
.
<s>
They
are
not
enrolled
in
high
school
or
college
.
<s>
They
are
unlikely
to
be
employed
.
<s>
And
they
have
grown
up
in
unprecedentedly
grim
circumstances
,
among
family
structures
breaking
down
,
surrounded
by
self-destructive
behaviors
and
bleak
prospects
.
<s>
But
many
of
them
can
be
quite
profoundly
reoriented
by
productive
and
disciplined
service
.
<s>
Some
wo
n't
accept
the
discipline
;
others
drop
out
for
other
reasons
.
<s>
But
some
whom
nothing
else
is
reaching
are
transformed
.
<s>
Learning
skills
,
producing
something
cooperatively
,
feeling
useful
,
they
are
no
longer
dependent
--
others
now
depend
on
them
.
<s>
Even
if
it
is
cheaper
to
build
playgrounds
or
paint
apartments
or
plant
dune-grass
with
paid
professionals
,
the
effects
on
the
young
people
providing
those
services
alter
the
calculation
.
<s>
Strictly
speaking
,
these
youth
are
not
performing
service
.
<s>
They
are
giving
up
no
income
,
deferring
no
careers
,
incurring
no
risk

But

believe
themselves

No

But
they

point
:
Do

<s>
Investors

sold
everything
after

lived
to
regret
it

,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
was
48
%
above
where
it
landed
on
Oct.
19
two
years
ago
.
<s>
Panic
selling
also
was
unwise
during
other
big
declines
in
the
past
.
<s>
The
crash
of
1929
was
followed
by
a
substantial
recovery
before

great
Depression

market

the
1930s

The
``
October

scary
,

did
n't
lead
to
severe
or
sustained
downturns
.

Indeed
,
some
pros
see
Friday
's
plunge
,

any
further
damage
that
might
occur
early
this
week
,
as
a
chance
for
bargain
hunting

market

the
advice

the

showing
slower

growth

a
severe
weakening

is
a
warning
sign

investors

<s>
One
strategy
for

is
to
buy
``
put
''
options

either

<s>
Whether
this
insurance

worthwhile
depends
on

cost

The
cost
,

premium
,
tends
to
get
fat
in
times
of

Thus
,
buying
puts
after
a

slide
can
be
an
expensive
way
to
hedge
against
risk

The
prices

puts
generally

For

,
the
premium

It
's
hard

generalize
about
a
reasonable
price
for

But
investors
should
keep
in
mind
,

much
,
that
the

long-term

calls

Federal

And
there
was
much
criticism

the
New

system

flow
through

When

<s>
This
observation
leads
us
to
another
piece
of
news
moving
on
the
Dow
Jones
ticker
shortly
before
the
downturn
:
the
success
of
Senate
Democrats
in
stalling
the
capital
gains
tax
cut
.
<s>
The
real
value
of
all
shares
,
after

,
is
directly
impacted
by
the
tax
on
any

-LRB-
all
the
more
so
given
the
limits
on
deductions
for
losses
that

-RRB-
.
<s>
And
market
expectations
clearly
have
been
raised
by
the
capital
gains
victory
in
the
House
last
month
.
<s>
An
hour
before
Friday
's
plunge
,
that
provision
was
stripped
from
the
tax
bill
,
leaving
it
with
$
5.4
billion
in
tax
increases
without
a
capital
gains
cut
.
<s>
There
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
,
to
be
sure
,
for
stripping
the
garbage
out
of
the
reconciliation
bill
.
<s>
It
would
be
a
good
thing
if
Congress
started
to
decide
issues
one-by-one
on
their
individual
merits
without
trickery
.
<s>
For
one
thing
,
no
one
doubts
that
the
capital
gains
cut
would
pass
on
an
up-or-down
vote
.
<s>
Since
Senate
leaders
have
so
far
fogged
it
up
with
procedural
smokescreens
,
promises
of
a
cleaner
bill
are
suspect
.
<s>
Especially
so
since
President
Bush
has
been
weakened
by
the
Panama
fiasco
.
<s>
To
the
extent
that
the
UAL
troubles
contributed
to
the
plunge
,
they
are
another
instance
of
Washington
's
sticky
fingers
.
<s>
As
the
best
opportunities
for
corporate
restructurings
are
exhausted
of
course
,
at
some
point
the
market
will
start
to
reject
them
.
<s>
But
the
airlines
are
scarcely
a
clear
case
,
given
anti-takeover
mischief
by
Secretary
of
Transportation
Skinner
,
who
professes
to
believe
safety
will
be
compromised
if
KLM
and
British
Airways
own
interests
in
companies
that
fly
airplanes
.
<s>
Worse
,
Congress
has
started
to
jump
on
the
Skinner
bandwagon
.
<s>
James
Oberstar
,
the
Minnesota
Democrat
who
chairs
the
Public
Works
and
Transportation
Committee
's
aviation
subcommittee
,
has
put
an
anti-airline
takeover
bill
on
supersonic
speed
so
that
it
would
be
passed
in
time
to
affect
the
American
and
United
Air
Lines
bids
.
<s>
It
would
give
Mr.
Skinner
up
to
50
days
to
``
review
''
any
bid
for
15
%
or
more
of
the
voting
stock
of
any
U.S.
carrier
with
revenues
of
$
1
billion
or
more
.
<s>
So
the
UAL
deal
has
problems
,
and
the
market
loses
190
points

bearish
side

that
may
be
too
much
to
expect

said
it

<s>
The
addition

brings
the

For

restored
--
in

of
Greece
's
eight-year
misadventure
under
autocratic
pseudosocialism
and
subsequent
three-month
hitch
with
a
conservative-communist
coalition
government
--
there
is
but
one
bright
sign
:
The
scandals
still
encircling
former
Prime
Minister
Andreas
Papandreou
and
his
fallen
socialist
government
are
like
flies
buzzing
around
a
rotting
carcass
.
<s>
In
the
mid-June
round
of
voting
,
Greeks
gave
no
clear
mandate
to
any
single
political
party
.
<s>
The
ad
interim
coalition
government
that
emerged
from
post-electoral
hagglings
was
,
in
essence
,
little
more
than
the
ill-conceived
offspring
of
ideological
miscegenation
:
On
one
side
,
the
center-right
New
Democracy
Party
,
headed
by
Constantine
Mitsotakis
.
<s>
On
the
other
,
the
so-called
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
--
a
quaint
and
rather
deceptive
title
for
a
merger
of
the
pro-Soviet
Communist
Party
of
Greece
and
its
Euro-Communist
cousin
,
the
Hellenic
Left
.
<s>
The
unifying
bond
for
this
left-right
mismatch
was
plain
:
PASOK
-LRB-
Mr.
Papandreou
's
party
-RRB-
as
common
political
enemy
.
<s>
The
ostensible
goal
was
a
mop-up
of
government
corruption
,
purportedly
at
all
levels
,
but
the
main
marks
were
Mr.
Papandreou
and
his
closest
associates
.
<s>
In
point
of
fact
,
this
catharsis
was
overdue
by
decades
.
<s>
When
reduced
to
buzzword
status
in
ex
parte
pledges
,
however
,
the
notion
transmogrified
into
a
promised
assault
,
with
targets
primarily
for
political
gains
,
not
justice
.
<s>
With
regard
to
Greece
's
long-bubbling
bank-looting
scandal
,
Mr.
Papandreou
's
principal
accuser
remains
George
Koskotas
,
former
owner
of
the
Bank
of
Crete
and
self-confessed
embezzler
,
now
residing
in
a
jail
cell
in
Salem
,
Mass.
,
from
where
he
is
fighting
extradition
proceedings
that
would
return
him
to
Greece
.
<s>
Mr.
Koskotas
's
credibility
is
,
at
best
,
problematic
.
<s>
He
has
ample
motive
to
shift
the
blame
,
and
his
testimony
has
also
been
found
less
than
forthright
on
numerous
points
.
<s>
Nevertheless
,
the
New
Democracy
and
Communist
parties
herald
his
assertions
as
proof
of
PASOK
complicity
.
<s>
Among
unanswered
questions
are
whether
Mr.
Papandreou
received
$
23
million
of
stolen
Bank
of
Crete
funds
and
an
additional
$
734,000
in
bribes
,
as
contended
;
whether
the
prime
minister
ordered
state
agencies
to
deposit
some
$
57
million
in
Mr.
Koskotas
's
bank
and
then
skim
off
the
interest
;
and
,
what
PASOK
's
cut
was
from
the
$
210
million
Mr.
Koskotas
pinched
.
<s>
Two
former
ministers
were
so
heavily
implicated
in
the
Koskotas
affair
that
PASOK
members
of
Parliament
voted
to
refer
them
to
the
special
court
.
<s>
But
eluding
parliamentary
probe
was
the
case
of
millions
of
drachmas
Mr.
Koskotas
funneled
into
New
Democracy
coffers
.
<s>
In
the
end
,
the
investigation
produced
only
circumstantial
evidence
and
``
indications
''
that
point
to
PASOK
,
not
clinching
proof
.
<s>
On
another
issue
,
Greeks
were
told
how
their
national
intelligence
agency
,
the
EYP
,
regularly
monitored
the
telephone
conversations
of
prominent
figures
,
including
key
opposition
politicians
,
journalists
and
PASOK
cabinet
members
.
<s>
Despite
convincing
arguments
,
it
was
never
established
that
Mr.
Papandreou
personally
ordered
or
directed
the
wiretaps
.
<s>
The
central
weakness
of
the
``
scandals
''
debates
was
pointed
up
especially
well
when
discussions
focused
on
arms
deals
and
kickbacks
.
<s>
The
coalition
government
tried
to
show
that
PASOK
ministers
had
received
hefty
sums
for
OKing
the
purchase
of
F-16
Fighting
Falcon
and
Mirage
2000
combat
aircraft
,
produced
by
the
U.S.based
General
Dynamics
Corp.
and
France
's
Avions
Marcel
Dassault
,
respectively
.
<s>
Naturally
,
neither
General
Dynamics
nor
Dassault
could
be
expected
to
hamper
its
prospective
future
dealings
by
making
disclosures
of
sums
paid
-LRB-
or
not
-RRB-
to
various
Greek
officials
for
services
rendered
.
<s>
So
it
seems
that
Mr.
Mitsotakis
and
his
communist
chums
may
have
unwittingly
served
Mr.
Papandreou
a
moral
victory
on
a
platter
:
PASOK
,
whether
guilty
or
not
,
can
now
traipse
the
countryside
condemning
the
whole
affair
as
a
witch
hunt
at
Mr.
Papandreou
's
expense
.
<s>
But
while
verbal
high
jinks
alone
wo
n't
help
PASOK
regain
power
,
Mr.
Papandreou
should
never
be
underestimated
.
<s>
First
came
his
predictable
fusillade
:
He
charged
the
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
had
sold
out
its
leftist
tenets
by
collaborating
in
a
right-wing
plot
aimed
at
ousting
PASOK
and
thwarting
the
course
of
socialism
in
Greece
.
<s>
Then
,
to
buttress
his
credibility
with
the
left
,
he
enticed
some
smaller
leftist
parties
to
stand
for
election
under
the
PASOK
banner
.
<s>
Next
,
he
continued
to
court
the
communists
--
many
of
whom
feel
betrayed
by
the
left-right
coalition
's
birth
--
by
bringing
into
PASOK
a
well-respected
Communist
Party
candidate
.
<s>
For
balance
,
and
in
hopes
of
gaining
some
disaffected
centrist
votes
,
he
managed
to
attract
a
former
New
Democracy
Party
representative
and
known
political
enemy
of
Mr.
Mitsotakis
.
<s>
Thus
PASOK
heads
for
the
polls
not
only
with
diminished
scandal-stench
,
but
also
with
``
seals
of
approval
''
from
representatives
of
its
harshest
accusers
.
<s>
Crucial
as
these
elections
are
for
Greece
,
pressing
issues
of
state
are
getting
lost
in
the
shuffle
.
<s>
The
country
's
future
NATO
participation
remains
unsure
,
for
instance
.
<s>
Greece
also
must
revamp
major
pieces
of
legislation
in
preparation
for
the
1992
targets
of
heightened
Common
Market
cooperation
.
<s>
Greece
's
bilateral
relations
with
the
U.S.
need
attention
soon
as
well
.
<s>
For
one
,
the
current
accord
concerning
U.S.
military
bases
in
Greece
lapses
in
May
1990
.
<s>
Negotiations
for
a
new
agreement
were
frozen
before
the
June
elections
,
but
the
clock
is
running
.
<s>
Another
matter
of
concern
is
the
extradition
of
Mohammed
Rashid
,
a
Palestinian
terrorist
who
is
wanted
in
the
U.S.
for
the
1982
bombing
of
a
Pan
American
Airways
flight
.
<s>
The
Greek
courts
have
decided
in
favor
of
extradition
in
the
Rashid
case
,
but
the
matter
awaits
final
approval
from
Greece
's
next
justice
minister
.
<s>
The
Greeks
seem
barely
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
case
as
a
litmus
test
of
whether
Greece
will
be
counted
in
or
out
for
international
efforts
to
combat
terrorism
.
<s>
That
PASOK
could
win
the
elections
outright
is
improbable
;
the
Greek
press
,
previously
eager
to
palm
off
PASOK
's
line
,
has
turned
on
Mr.
Papandreou
with
a
wild-eyed
vengeance
.
<s>
Yet
the
possibility
of
another
lash-up
government
is
all
too
real
.
<s>
If
Mr.
Papandreou
becomes
the
major
opposition
leader
,
he
could
hamstring
a
conservative-led
coalition
.
<s>
Also
,
he
could
force
new
elections
early
next
year
by
frustrating
the
procedures
for
the
election
of
the
president
of
the
republic
in
March
.
<s>
New
Democracy
has
once
again
glaringly
underestimated
the
opponent
and
linked
its
own
prospects
to
negative
reaction
against
PASOK
,
forgetting
to
tend
to
either
program
clarity
or
the
rectification
of
internal
squabbles
.
<s>
As
for
Mr.
Papandreou
?
<s>
He
's
not
exactly
sitting
pretty
at
this
stage
.
<s>
But
since
he
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
proficient
bull
slingers
who
ever
raked
muck

it
seems
far
wiser
to
view
him

In

Why

Metropolitan

<s>
To
some
observers
,
the
empty

<s>
Today
,
metropolitan
Houston

Denver
is
another
metropolitan
area
where

overreacted

Denver
has
not
experienced
as

an
economic

as
Houston

<s>
By
some
measures
,
metropolitan
Denver
's
economy
has
actually
improved

The

for
more
turmoil
and
uncertainty
in
this
racially
divided
country
.
<s>
As
other
repressive
governments
,
particularly
Poland
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
have
recently
discovered
,
initial
steps
to
open
up
society
can
create
a
momentum
for
radical
change
that
becomes
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
control
.
<s>
As
the
days
go
by
,
the
South
African
government
will
be
ever
more
hard
pressed
to
justify
the
continued
imprisonment
of
Mr.
Mandela
as
well
as
the
continued
banning
of
the
ANC
and
enforcement
of
the
state
of
emergency
.
<s>
If
it
does
n't
yield
on
these
matters
,
and
eventually
begin
talking
directly
to
the
ANC
,
the
expectations
and
promise
raised
by
yesterday
's
releases
will
turn
to
disillusionment
and
unrest
.
<s>
If
it
does
,
the
large
number
of
right-wing
whites
,
who
oppose
any
concessions
to
the
black
majority
,
will
step
up
their
agitation
and
threats
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
.
<s>
The
newly
released
ANC
leaders
also
will
be
under
enormous
pressure
.
<s>
The
government
is
watching
closely
to
see
if
their
presence
in
the
townships
leads
to
increased
anti-government
protests
and
violence
;
if
it
does
,
Pretoria
will
use
this
as
a
reason
to
keep
Mr.
Mandela
behind
bars
.
<s>
Pretoria
has
n't
forgotten
why
they
were
all
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
first
place
:
for
sabotage
and
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
.
<s>
In
addition
,
the
government
is
figuring
that
the
releases
could
create
a
split
between
the
internal
and
external
wings
of
the
ANC
and
between
the
newly
freed
leaders
and
those
activists
who
have
emerged
as
leaders
inside
the
country
during
their
imprisonment
.
<s>
In
order
to
head
off
any
divisions
,
Mr.
Mandela
,
in
a
meeting
with
his
colleagues
before
they
were
released
,
instructed
them
to
report
to
the
ANC
headquarters
in
Lusaka
as
soon
as
possible
.
<s>
The
men
also
will
be
faced
with
bridging
the
generation
gap
between
themselves
and
the
country
's
many
militant
black
youths
,
the
so-called
young
lions
who
are
anxious
to
see
the
old
lions
in
action
.
<s>
Says
Peter
Mokaba
,
president
of
the
South
African
Youth
Congress
:
``
We
will
be
expecting
them
to
act
like
leaders
of
the
ANC
.
''
<s>
They
never
considered
themselves
to
be
anything
else
.
<s>
At
last
night
's
rally
,
they
called
on
their
followers
to
be
firm
,
yet
disciplined
,
in
their
opposition
to
apartheid
.
<s>
``
We
emphasize
discipline
because
we
know
that
the
government
is
very
,
very
sensitive
,
''
said
Andrew
Mlangeni
,
another
early
Umkhonto
leader
who
is
now
63
.
<s>
``
We
want
to
see
Nelson
Mandela
and
all
our
comrades
out
of
prison
,
and
if
we
are
n't
disciplined
we
may
not
see
them
here
with
us
.
