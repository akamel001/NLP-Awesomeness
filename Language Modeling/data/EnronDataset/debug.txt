beck-s	    USA: RESEARCH ALERT - Enron price target raised.      01/12/2000   Reuters English News Service   (C) Reuters Limited 2000.    NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schroder & Co Inc said Wednesday it raised  Enron Corp's price target to $75 from $60 and cut  2000 earnings per share estimates.   - raised price target because "as the bandwidth trading market unfolds over  the next 12 months, we anticipate that an additional $15 of  value will be created for shareholders, with considerably greater value  possible as the market develops."   - cut 2000 estimates to $1.45 per share from $1.55 "due to fine-tuning."   - introduced 2001 EPS of $1.75.   - "Bandwidth trading will be a critical value creator in 2000. Enron has  built a critical base in the emerging bandwidth commodity  industry, which is poised to achieve rapid growth in 2000."   - "Bandwidth trading keys off Enron's market dominant skills developed in  trading electricity and natural gas. After executing the first  key bandwidth trade in 1999, Enron appears poised to begin posting rising  transaction volumes, establishing the credibility of this new  industry."   - "The ultimate value of bandwidth trading is likely to exceed the total  value of Enron's existing electricity and gas franchise."

kaminski-v	 Osman,  This guy is too much. I would tell him that we understand that he has to make the best choice for himself  and can change his mind  but at this point we treat  his decision as final but we still  appreciate the interest he showed in Enron.  We never had any luck hiring a statistician. Maybe we shall get one some day.

He also mentions that the other organization will give him time to publish his  thesis and he  assumes  Enron would not do that.  I am inclined to give up on him but wanted to get your input before doing so.  Osman
